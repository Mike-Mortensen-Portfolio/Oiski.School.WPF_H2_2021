## Versioning
The Assignment specifies that versioning should be done according to the following template: [_Major_].[_Minor_].[_Path_].\
Each `Feature` must be branched out and developed on an isolated branch and merged back into the `Developer` branch when done.

The syntax for the structure of folders must be presented as: [DeveloperName]/[Version]/[BranchName], where as branches should be named as follows: [*Version*]-[*Feature*]_[*SubFeature*].\
**Example:**
>**Folder Structure:** _Oiski/v1_ \
>**Branch Name:** _1.0.0-Interface_MainMenu_ \
>**Full Path:** _Oiski/v1/1.0.0-Interface_MainMenu__
